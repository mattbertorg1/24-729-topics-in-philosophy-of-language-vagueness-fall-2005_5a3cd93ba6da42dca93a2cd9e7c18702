This section features information about the final paper required of students taking the course for credit.

Final Paper
-----------

Your final paper must be a substantial journal-style discussion of an issue related to the topics discussed in class. Primarily expositional pieces are discouraged -- I want to see you tackle the problems yourself. There are no fixed length constraints, but 30 double-space pages is typical.
